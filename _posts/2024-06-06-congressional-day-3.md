# App Idea

A job finder platform that helps people who are struggling to find a profession they want to pursue find suitable options, maybe with a quiz or directory? Show openings for those jobs, information and average pay for these jobs, and possibly add AI to ask more detailed questions.[^1]

[^1]: Evaluate people's answers


# Observations

 - It's hard to make a decision because the options are separated by radio buttons.
 - Questions are too context dependent
 - Hard to be honest with yourself because it could change at any moment
 - Personality may be complex enouogh to include more than just the result given

 ## The Holland Code

  - The main test used to identify potential career choices. Endorsed by US Department of Labor Employment and training, according to [IDRLabs](https://ww.idrlabs.com/career-code/test.php).
  - Also called the RIASEC test.
  - Inconsistent test formats, each website has a different design or method of testing its users

# Test Formats

1. Paginated questions [Example](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/RIASEC/)
2. Checkbox answers [Example](https://www.roguecc.edu/Counseling/HollandCodes/test.asp)
3. Sliders (snapping options) [Example](https://www.idrlabs.com/career-code/test.php)

7. Best and Worst [Example](https://www.123test.com/career-test/)
8. Yes or No [Example](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/holland-code)

## Things to note

 - The test is not a comprehensive list of all the careers that could be considered
 - Some tests have progress bars or time limits which could add additional pressure
 - Method of testing PC vs iPad vs pen and paper can make a difference
